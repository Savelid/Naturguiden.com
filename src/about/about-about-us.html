                <p>Naturguiden was founded in 1996 and since then has given thousands of people a great time in the Swedish
                    nature.<br />
                <h3>Ecoturism</h3>
                <p>Ecotourism or a nature friendly approach is important for us. We are member of the Swedish ecotourist organisation and try to minimize our impact on the environment.</p>    
                We are located in Linköping, 200 km south of Stockholm, in the county of Östergötland but our activities
                    take place all over Sweden. We always try to find the best possible places for our different outdoor
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p>Our kayak tours are normally in the archipelago south of Stockholm.  On the skating tours we meet you at Stockholm airport / Arlanda.</p>
                <p>The Hiking and Skiing tours are in a remote part of Sweden. We start the tours in Ljungdalen and here we have the mountain almost by ourselves.</p>
                <p><i>But of course different locations are possible.<i></i></p>
                <br />
                <p>We have found the most beautiful places for you, we have all equipment you need. We have done all preparation, you just have to show up and enjoy.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Welcome to join us on our tours</p>
