                        <h1>Nordic Skating - the weekend tour for you</h1>
                        <p class="lead">Nordic skating in Sweden, an all inclusive guided tour with a lot of good skating. We travel by minibus
                            in small groups of maximum eight persons and one guide. Your guide picks you up at the airport/train
                            station and if possible we go directly for skating on a good lake nearby. All needed equipment
                            for skating is provided. We sleep in hostels and are making the dinner together in the evenings.
                            At breakfast we also prepare our lunch that we bring in our backpacks.</p>
                        <p>Where we skate depends on the ice and weather situation, we always choose the area that provides
                            the best skating conditions. The accommodations are located in the area but could change from
                            day to day depending on where we choose to go skating.</p>
                        <P>
                            <I>If you come together with your friends or family and you are 4-6 persons or more consider the
                                options for your own private tour.

                        </P>
                        <P>As the speed and the distance we like to skate differs depending on our guests' previous skating
                            experience and fitness level we offer some weekends for those with more experience and other
                            weekends for those with less. You don't need to be a champion to join the tour for more experienced
                            skaters but you should be able to skate on ice skates or rollerblades without difficulties and
                            be reasonable fit.
                        </p>

                        <p>If there is an interest for other weekends do not hesitate to contact us. We do have groups coming
                            every weekend from early January to mid March, it might be possible to join a group with less
                            than eight participants.</p>

                        <h3>A normal day on the ice</h3>
                        <p>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we
                            head off for skating. If we are lucky we can walk from our accomodation directly out on the ice.
                            Otherwise we take the minibus to the lake. The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking
                            out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice condition. Now
                            and then we take short stops to admire the beautiful landscape, chat for a while or just rest.
                            During the day we go ashore from time to time, for the first or second lunch break or for walking
                            to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel.
                            A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might
                            go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>

                        <div class="right-image image-width-sm">
                            <img src="/images/200/sweskate.jpg" class="full-width">

                        </div>

                        <p>We use special skates well adopted for Nordic skating. They are longer than hockey or figure skates.
                            The front has a long curve compared to speed skates with sharp front, which is necessary if the
                            ice in not completely smooth. And most important, the skate and the boot are separate so you
                            can take off the skate when walking to and from the ice. If you have suitable skates, for example
                            the Salomon skates, you may use them if you like.</p>

                        <h3>About safety</h3>
                        <img width="300" src="/images/500/safety_eq.jpg" class="right-image image-width-md">
                        <p>
                            Safety is an important issue. We cover great distances on the ice during a day. The whole time we keep track of the quality
                            of the ice and avoid all weak areas. If someone should break through the ice the safety equipment
                            we have helps us to pick the person up in a minute. And soon all wet clothes are changed to dry
                            and warm clothes. The skating trip can continue.
                        </p>
                        <p>PS: The only time we had a person falling into the water, they did not follow the given instructions.</p>

                        <p>
                            Safety equipment we carry: backpack, safety line, ice nails and poles

                        <h3>Day I</h3>
                        <P>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and if possible we start skating already in the afternoon.
                            We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. Time to change
                            to proper clothes if you have not yet done that. Late afternoon we drive towards the chosen skating
                            area. Arriving to the hostel/hotel you check in and then we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</P>
                        <h3>Day II – III</h3>
                        <P>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on distance we walk or take
                            the minibus towards the ice. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we put on the skates
                            and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking
                            out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice condition. Now
                            and then we take short stops to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the
                            day we go ashore from time to time to take something to eat or walk to another lake nearby. At
                            the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before
                            the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating
                            trip in moonlight late in the evening.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Day IV</h3>
                        <P>
                            After breakfast we head off to another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the scheduled departure times.
                            On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and to change clothes and maybe for something
                            to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.
