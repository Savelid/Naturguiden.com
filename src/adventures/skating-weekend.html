                        <p class="lead">Nordic skating in Sweden, an all inclusive guided tour with a lot of good skating. We travel in small
                            groups of maximum eight persons and one guide in a van. The guide pick you up at the airport/train
                            station and if possible we go directly for skating on a good lake nearby. All needed equipment
                            for skating is provided. We sleep in hostels and making the dinner together in the evenings.
                            At breakfast we also prepare our lunch that we bring in our backpacks.</p>
                        <p>Where we skate depends on the ice and weather situation, we always choose the area that provides
                            the best skating conditions. The accommodations are located in the area but could change from
                            day to day depending on where we choose to go skating.</p>
                        <P>
                            <I>If you come together with your friends or family and you are 4-6 persons or more consider the
                                options for your own private tour.

                        <p>If there is an interest for other weekends do not hesitate to contact us. We do have groups coming
                            every weekend from early January to mid March, it might be possible to join a group with less
                            than eight participants.</p>

                        <h3>A normal day on the ice</h3>
                        <p>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we
                            head of for skating. If we are lucky we stay close to the lake and walk directly out on the ice.
                            Otherwise we take the van to the lake. The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking
                            out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now
                            and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the
                            day we make several stops when we go ashore, for the first or second lunch break or for walking
                            to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the van and head back to the hotel/hostel.
                            A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might
                            go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>

                            <p>We use special skates well adopted for Nordic skating. They are longer than hockey or figure
                                skates. The front has a long curve compared with speed skates sharp front. Necessary if the
                                ice in not complete smooth. And most important, the skate and the boot are separate so you
                                can take of the skate when walking to and from the ice. If you have suitable skates, for
                                example the Salomon skates, you may use them if you like.</p>

                                Safety is an important issue. We cover great distance on the ice during a day. The whole time we keep track on the quality
                                of the ice and avoid all week areas. But if we still have an accident and someone fell through
                                the ice the safety equipment we have help us to pick up the person in a minute. And soon
                                all wet cloth are changed to dry and warm cloth. The skating trip can continue.
                            </p>
                            <p>PS: The only time we had a person fell into the water, they had not follow the given instructions.</p>

                        <P>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on distance we walk or take
                            the minibus towards the ice. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we get the gear
                            on and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking
                            out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now
                            and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the
                            day we make several stops when we go ashore to take something to eat or walk to another lake
                            nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice
                            sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for
                            another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>
                        <h3>Day IV</h3>
                        <P>After breakfast we head off for another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the
                            scheduled departure times. On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and change clothes
                            and maybe for something to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.</P>
