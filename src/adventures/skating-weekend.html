                    <h1>Nordic Skating - the weekend tour for you</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Nordic skating in Sweden, an all inclusive guided tour with a lot of good skating. We travel by minibus
                        in small groups of maximum eight persons and one guide. Your guide picks you up at the airport/train
                        station and if possible we go directly for skating on a good lake nearby. All needed equipment for
                        skating is provided. We sleep in hostels and are making the dinner together in the evenings. At breakfast
                        we also prepare our lunch that we bring in our backpacks.</p>
                    <p>Where we skate depends on the ice and weather situation, we always choose the area that provides the
                        best skating conditions. The accommodations are located in the area but could change from day to
                        day depending on where we choose to go skating.</p>
                    <P>
                        <I>If you come together with your friends or family and you are 4-6 persons or more consider the options
                            for your own private tour.

                        </I>
                    </P>
                    <P>As the speed and the distance we like to skate differs depending on our guests' previous skating experience
                        and fitness level we offer some weekends for those with more experience and other weekends for those
                        with less. You don't need to be a champion to join the tour for more experienced skaters but you
                        should be able to skate on ice skates or rollerblades without difficulties and be reasonable fit.
                    </p>

                    <p>If there is an interest for other weekends do not hesitate to contact us. We do have groups coming every
                        weekend from early January to mid March, it might be possible to join a group with less than eight
                        participants.</p>

                    <h3>A normal day on the ice</h3>
                    <p>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we head
                        off for skating. If we are lucky we can walk from our accomodation directly out on the ice. Otherwise
                        we take the minibus to the lake. The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking out for
                        weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice condition. Now and then we
                        take short stops to admire the beautiful landscape, chat for a while or just rest. During the day
                        we go ashore from time to time, for the first or second lunch break or for walking to another lake
                        nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice
                        sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another
                        skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>

                    <h3>About the skates</h3>
                    <div class="right-image image-width-sm">
                        <img src="/images/200/sweskate.jpg" class="full-width">
                        <img src="/images/200/schoen.jpg" class="full-width">
                    </div>

                    <p>We use special skates well adopted for Nordic skating. They are longer than hockey or figure skates.
                        The front has a long curve compared to speed skates with sharp front, which is necessary if the ice
                        in not completely smooth. And most important, the skate and the boot are separate so you can take
                        off the skate when walking to and from the ice. If you have suitable skates, for example the Salomon
                        skates, you may use them if you like.</p>

                    <h3>About safety</h3>
                    <img width="300" src="/images/500/safety_eq.jpg" class="right-image image-width-md">
                    <p>
                        Safety is an important issue. We cover great distances on the ice during a day. The whole time we keep track of the quality
                        of the ice and avoid all weak areas. If someone should break through the ice the safety equipment
                        we have helps us to pick the person up in a minute. And soon all wet clothes are changed to dry and
                        warm clothes. The skating trip can continue.
                    </p>
                    <p>PS: The only time we had a person falling into the water, they did not follow the given instructions.</p>

                    <p>
                        Safety equipment we carry: backpack, safety line, ice nails and poles
                    </p>

                    <h3>Program for the four days</h3>
                    <h3>Day I</h3>
                    <P>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and if possible we start skating already in the afternoon.
                        We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. Time to change to proper
                        clothes if you have not yet done that. Late afternoon we drive towards the chosen skating area. Arriving
                        to the hostel/hotel you check in and then we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</P>
                    <h3>Day II – III</h3>
                    <P>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on distance we walk or take
                        the minibus towards the ice. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we put on the skates
                        and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking
                        out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice condition. Now and
                        then we take short stops to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we go
                        ashore from time to time to take something to eat or walk to another lake nearby. At the end of the
                        day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is
                        a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight
                        late in the evening.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Day IV</h3>
                    <P>
                        After breakfast we head off to another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the scheduled departure times.
                        On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and to change clothes and maybe for something
                        to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.
