                <p>** As the tempo and the distance we like to skate differs depending on our previous skating experiences and fittnes we have some weekends for those with more experiences and other weekends for those with less. You don't need to be an champion to join the tour for more experienced skaters but you should be able to skate on ice skates or Rollerblades without difficulties. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.</p>
                <h3>Time for arrival and departure:</h3> 
                <p><b>Arrival:</b> Choose your time, but rather before 17:00 (confirm with us before booking the ticket). Our normal pick up times are 12:00 and 17:00. If you arrive mid day we find a place close to the airport where we went for skating. If other guests arrives later we then went back to the airport and pick them up. Late afternoon we head of for the the place to stay the first night.</p>
                <p><b>Departure:</b> Not before 17:00.</p>
                            
                <h3>A normal day on the ice</h3>
                <p>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we head of for skating. If we are lucky we stay close to the lake and walk directly out on the ice. Otherwise we take the van to the lake.  The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we make several stops when we go ashore, for the first or second lunch break or for walking to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the van and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>

                <h4>About the skates</h4>
                <p>We use special skates well adopted for Nordic skating. They are longer than hockey or figure skates. The front has a long curve compared with speed skates sharp front. Necessary if the ice in not complete smooth. And most important, the skate and the boot are separate so you can take of the skate when walking to and from the ice. If you have suitable skates, for example the Salomon skates, you may use them if you like.</p>
                <h4>About safety</h4>
                <p>Safety is an important issue. We cover great distance on the ice during a day. The whole time we keep track on the quality of the ice and avoid all week areas. But if we still have an accident and someone fell through the ice the safety equipment we have help us to pick up the person in a minute. And soon all wet cloth are changed to dry and warm cloth. The skating trip can continue.</p> 
                <p>PS: The only time we had a person fell into the water, they had not follow the given instructions.</p>
