                            and the huge expanse of glossy ice – everything is here waiting for you. We skate on some of
                            Sweden's many lakes, the Göta Kanal or in the beautiful archipelago.</p>

                            still winter, but with long lasting sunshine days. Sun factor 20 is needed.</p>

                        <p>We cross the snowy mountains under a blue sky, take our breaks in dug couches of snow and spend the
                            nights in mountain lodges. Days of enjoyment, experience and fantastic views!</p>

                        <p>Join us on our Kayak tours in the beautiful archipelago of the Baltic sea. Between islands and skerries,
                            out in the open sea and in seduced caves. There are thousands of islands, most of them unsettled.
                            The Swedish "allemansrätt" gives us the right to camp on any one of them. At lunchtime we make
                            a break on some island, cock a meal, maybe take a swim. In the evenings we camp on another island,
                            make dinner over open fire and sleep in tents.</p>
