                            details are not set, we decide from day to day how the trip will develop. We bring our own tents
                            (which will be provided) and all the food we need. We are totally free to experience the wild,
                            outside all regular tracks and mountain lodges.</p>

                            <i>"Sweden's highest peak south of the Arctic Circle, Helagsfjället, also simply called Helags,
                                stands out above the surrounding peaks of the Scandinavian Mountains right on the Norway
                                border."

                            <p>On Helags there is also a glacier that we will visit and maybe we will visit the mountain Sylarna
                                as well</p>
                            <p>Another highlight is the arctic fox in the area. They are very rare, but with hard work from
                                some enthusiasts that have brought out food to them for many years, they are now starting to
                                come back to the area.

                        <p>While hiking in the Swedish mountains we stay above tree level, the area where no trees can grow.
                            It is still green with grass and flowers. We are exposed to the force of nature with only tents
                            for shelter during the nights that never get dark. We wash ourselves outdoors in the cold and
                            crystal clear water of the rivers. We prepare lunch close to a small river. Probably not meeting
                            any other people, only the reindeer and lemmings.</p>
                        <p>The tour starts in Ljungdalen, the south port to the Jämtland mountains.</p>

                        <h3>A normal day in the mountains</h3>
                        <p>We start with preparing breakfast on the camping stove. Water we get from the crystal clear creek
                            nearby. Then we put down our tents and start our journey. When we walk over a creek we take a
                            short stop to drink. Now and then we take a short break. Around lunch time we take a longer break
                            close to a river or creek, preparing lunch on our camping stove.</p>
                        <p>In the evening we find a nice place for our tents. Making diner over open fire or on the camping
                            stove and wash ourself in the river or in a lake (yes, it is probably very cold). We will probably
                            meet reindeer and lemmings, a lot of different birds, and we will try to g spot the
                            arctic fox in the area.</p>

                        <p>Some of the days we stay two nights at the same place and from there start a summit hike to some of the
                            peaks, e.g. Helags. We will also try to catch fish in the small lakes and fry them over open fire.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Meeting point</h3>
                        <p>Normally we start our tours in Ljungdalen. A small village up in the mountains. South of Åre and
                            close to the Norwegian border.</p>

                        <p>Travel to Ljungdalen. </p>
                        <p>Accommodation in Ljungdalen hostel. Dinner and briefing about the tour. Then time for all preparation
                            and sharing food and other equipment among us.</p>
                        <p>Clothes and other belongings not needed on the hike can be left here until you get back.</p>

                        <h3>Day II</h3>
                        <p>Breakfast at the Hostel and then we head off. First through the village and then up into the forest.
                            We follow the old pilgrim path toward Trondheim in Norway. After 4 km we get up above the tree
                            level, here you get the first sight of Helags</p>
                        <p>A little further and then it's time for our first lunch break. With a great view over the lake below
                            and the sound from the creek we start cooking. Later in the afternoon we have passed our first
                            mountains and now we have Helags in front of us. We find a nice spot close to some water where
                            we put up our tents. We do some cooking and start doing the plan for tomorrow.</p>

                        <h3>Day III – XIII</h3>
                        <p>The high peaks of Sylarna and Helags are in front of us but how should we climb them? What is the
                            weather forecast? How far should we walk today? Is there any reindeer down in the valley to see?
                            We continue taking one day at a time, stop and drink the crystal clear water from a stream,
                            stretch out in the sun during lunch and take a bath in cold water in the river in the evening.
                            Maybe we decide to walk the whole night, in July it never gets dark.</p>

                        <p>These are magnificent but hard days. High mountains to climb, fantastic views to enjoy and natural
                            peacefulness without any other people.</p>

                        <h3>Day VIII</h3>
                        <p>The last stage is walking down towards Ljungdalen– an easy path where long parts are downhill. The
                            hiking starts right after breakfast and after lunchtime we reach Ljungdalen. Now it is time to
                            get a real shower at the hostel, or maybe a sauna. In the evening we get dinner at the local
                            restaurant.
                        </p>
