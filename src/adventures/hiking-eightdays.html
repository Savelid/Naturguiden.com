                                    <h1>Eight days in the wild</h1>
                                    <p class="lead">Eight adventurous days filled with mountain peak tours, glacier hiking and magnificent nature! The details are not set, we decide from day to day how the trip will develop. We bring our own tents (which will be provided) and all the food we need. We are totally free to experience the wild, outside all regular tracks and mountain lodges.</p>
                                    <div class="high-light">
                                        <p></p>But for sure we will do a summit hike to Helags. Number three among the World's best summit hikes according to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/lists/hiking-backpacking/worlds-best-summit-hikes/#/helagsfjallet-mountain-sweden_91186_600x450.jpg"> National Geographic</a> <i>"Sweden's highest peak south of the Arctic Circle, Helagsfjället, also simply called Helags, stands out above the surrounding peaks of the Scandinavian Mountains right on the Norway border."</i></p>
                                        <p>On Helags there is also a glacier that we will visit and maybe we will visit the mountain Sylarna as well</p>
                                        <p>Another high light is the arctic fox in the area. They are very rare, but with hard work from some enthusiasts that have bring out food to them for many years, they are now starts to coming back.  <a href="https://www.rewildingeurope.com/news/arctic-fox-safaris-in-sweden-helps-the-arctic-fox-while-making-business-sense/">Read more about the arctic fox project in the region</a></p>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>While hiking in the Swedish mountains we stay above tree level, the area where no trees can grow. It is still green with grass and flowers. We are exposed to the force of nature with only tents for shelter during the nights that never get dark. We wash ourselves outdoors in the cold and crystal clear water of the rivers. We prepare lunch close to a small river. Probably not meeting any other people, only the reindeer's and lemmings.</p>
                                    <p>The tour starts in Ljungdalen, the south port to the Jämtland mountains.</p>

                                        <I>If you come together with your friends or family and you are 4-6 persons or more consider the options for your own private tour. <a href="adventures/hiking_yourown.html">Read more here..</a></I>

                                    <h3>A normal day in the mountains</h3>
                                    <p>We start with preparing breakfast on the camping stove. Water we get from the crystal clear creak nearby. Then we put down our tents and start our journey. When we walk over a creek we take a short stop to drink. Now and then we take a short break. Around lunch time we take a longer break close to a river or creek, preparing lunch on our camping stove.</p>
                                    <p>In the evening we find a nice place for our tents. Making diner over open fire or on the camping stove and wash ourself in the river or in a lake (yes, it is probably very cold). We will probably meet reindeer's and lemmings, a lot of different birds, and we will try to get a spot of the arctic fox in the area.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Some of the days we stay two nights at same place and from there make a summit hike to some of the peaks, i.e Helags. We will also try to catch fish in the small lakes and fry them over open fire. </p>
            
                                    <h3>Meeting point</h3>
                                    <p>Normally we start our tours in Ljungdalen. A small village up in the mountains. South of Åre and close to the Norwegian border.</p>

                                    <p>Travel to Ljungdalen. </p>
                                    <p>Accommodation in Ljungdalen hostel. Dinner and briefing about the tour. Then time for all preparation and sharing food and other equipment among us.</p>
                                    <p>Clothes and other belongings not needed on the hike can be left here until you get back.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Day II</h3>
                                    <p>Breakfast at the Hostel and then we head of. First through the village and then up into the forest. We follow the old pilgrim path toward Trondheim in Norway. After 4 km we get up above the three level, here you get the first sight of Helags</p>
                                    <p>A little further and then it's time for our first lunch break. With a great view over the lake below and the sound from the creek we start cooking. Later in the afternoon we have passed our first mountains and now we have Helags in front of us. We find a nice spots close to some water were we put up our tents. We do some cooking and start doing the plan for tomorrow.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Day III – XIII</h3>
                                     <p>The high peaks of Sylarna and Helags are in front of us but how should we climb them? What is the weather forecast? How far should we walk today? Is there any reindeer down in the valley to see? We head on taking one day at a time, stop and drink the crystal clear water from a murmur stream, stretch out in the sun during lunch and take a bath in cold water in the river in the evening. Maybe we decide to walk the whole night, in July it never gets dark.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>These are magnificent but hard days. High mountains to climb, fantastic views to see and natural peacefulness without any other people.</p>
                                                                  
                                    <h3>Day VIII</h3>
                                    <p>The last stage is going down towards Ljungdalen– an easy stretch where long parts are downhill. The hiking starts right after breakfast and after lunchtime we reach Ljungdalen. Now it is time to get a real shower at the hostel, or maybe a sauna. In the evening we get dinner at the local restaurant.</p>

                                    <h3>Day IX</h3>    
                                    <p>Last day, time to relax and to see more of Ljungdalen. Visit the old "Gammelgården" were you can get waffle with cloudberry jam. Or "Hemslöjden" where you can see or buy handicraft made by people in the village.</p>
                                    <p>The bus will bring you back towards Östersund/Stockholm around 15:00</p>
