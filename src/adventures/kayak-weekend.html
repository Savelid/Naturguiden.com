                        <h1>Kayak in the archipelago</h1>
                        <p class="lead">During three days we paddle kayaks in the beautiful archipelago south of Stockholm. Between islands
                            and skerries, out in the open sea and in seduced caves. We sleep in tents on the islands along
                            the way, prepare the food over open fire and wash ourselves in rock pools of the Baltic Sea.</p>
                        <p>With kayak out on the Baltic sea. Out among thousands of islands, most of them unsettled. The Swedish
                            “allemansrätt” gives us the opportunity to stay on any one of them. There is no fix tour, the
                            wind and waves affect our plans and you never now where to spend the night. During the day we
                            make several stops, for a meal or just to stretch our legs. In the evening, after a swim we make
                            a fire and start making dinner. Maybe we manage to catch some fish that we can fry in the pan.</p>
                        <P>
                            <I>If you come together with your friends or family and you are 4-6 persons or more consider the options for your own private tour. <a href="/adventures/kayak-yourown">Read more here..</a></I>

                        <h3>A normal day in the archipelago</h3>
                        <p>We start with breakfast prepared at the shoreline on the camping stove. Maybe porridge, bread and
                            te/coffe. Then we put down our tents and stow everything in our kayaks. We head of out between
                            the islands. The weather and wind decide were to go, out on the open or close to the islands.</p>
                        <p>At lunch time we find a nice spot where we can prepare our lunch, take a swim or just stroll along
                            the shore line</p>
                        <p>In the evening we take a swim, spend time around the fire, and make dinner over open fire. Maybe
                            someone try to catch a fish that we can eat as well. Just enjoy</p>
