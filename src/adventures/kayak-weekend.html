                                    <h1>Kayak in the archipelago</h1>
                                    <p class="lead">During three days we paddle kayaks in the beautiful archipelago south of Stockholm. Between islands and skerries, out in the open sea and in seduced caves. We sleep in tents on the islands along the way, prepare the food over open fire and wash ourselves in rock pools of the Baltic Sea.</p>
                                    <p>With kayak out on the Baltic sea. Out among thousands of islands, most of them unsettled. The Swedish “allemansrätt” gives us the opportunity to stay on any one of them. There is no fix tour, the wind and waves affect our plans and you never now where to spend the night. During the day we make several stops, for a meal or just to stretch our legs. In the evening, after a swim we make a fire and start making dinner. Maybe we manage to catch some fish that we can fry in the pan.</p>
                                    <P>
                                        <I>If you come together with your friends or family and you are 4-6 persons or more consider the options for your own private tour. <a href="adventures/kayak_yourown.html">Read more here..</a></I>

                                    <p>We start with breakfast prepared at the shoreline on the camping stove. Maybe porridge, bread and te/coffe. Then we put down our tents and stow everything in our kayaks. We head of out between the islands. The weather and wind decide were to go, out on the open or close to the islands.</p>
                                    <p>At lunch time we find a nice spot where we can prepare our lunch, take a swim or just stroll along the shore line</p>
                                    <p>In the evening we take a swim, spend time around the fire, and make dinner over open fire. Maybe someone try to cath a fish that we can eat as well. Just enjoy</p>

                                    <h3>Day I</h3>
                                    <P>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and if possible we start skating already in the afternoon.
                                        We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. Time to change
                                        to proper cloth if you have not. Late afternoon we drive towards the chosen skating area. Arriving
                                        to the hostel/hotel you check in and then we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</P>
                                    <h3>Day II – III</h3>
                                    <P>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on distance we walk or take
                                        the minibus towards the ice. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we get the gear
                                        on and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking
                                        out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now
                                        and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the
                                        day we make several stops when we go ashore to take something to eat or walk to another lake
                                        nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice
                                        sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for
                                        another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>
                                    <h3>Day IV</h3>
                                    <P>After breakfast we head off for another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the
                                        scheduled departure times. On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and change clothes
                                        and maybe for something to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.</P>
