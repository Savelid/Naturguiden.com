                                    <p class="lead">Eight adventurous days filled with mountain peak tours, glacier hiking and magnificent nature! The details are not set, we decide from day to day how the trip will develop. We bring our own tents (which will be provided) and all the food we need. We are totally free to experience the wild, outside all regular tracks and mountain lodges.</p>
                                    <div class="high-light">
                                        <p></p>But for sure we will do a summit hike to Helags. Number three among the World's best summit hikes according to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/lists/hiking-backpacking/worlds-best-summit-hikes/#/helagsfjallet-mountain-sweden_91186_600x450.jpg"> National Geographic</a> <i>"Sweden's highest peak south of the Arctic Circle, Helagsfjället, also simply called Helags, stands out above the surrounding peaks of the Scandinavian Mountains right on the Norway border."</i></p>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>While hiking in the Swedish mountains we stay above tree level, the area where no trees can grow. It is still green with grass and flowers. We are exposed to the force of nature with only tents for shelter during the nights that never get dark. We wash ourselves outdoors in the cold and crystal clear water of the rivers. We prepare lunch close to a small river. Probably not meeting any other people, only the reindeers and lemmings.</p>
                                    <p>The tour starts in Ljungdalen, the south port to the Jämtland mountains. You get here with car or with buss from Östersund. We will provide you with travel information.</p>

                                        <I>If you come together with your friends or family and you are 4-6 persons or more consider the options for your own private tour. <a href="adventures/hiking_yourown.html">Read more here..</a></I>

                                    <h3>A normal day in the mountains</h3>
                                    <p>We start with preparing breakfast on the camping stove. Wather we get from the cristal clear creak nearby. Then we put down our tents and start our journey. When we walk over a creek we take a short stop to drink. Now and then we take a short break. Around lunch time we take a longer break close to a river or creek, preparing lunch on our camping stove.</p>
                                    In the evening we find a nice place for our tents. Making diner over open fire or on the camping stove and wash ourself in the river or in a lake (yes, it is probably very cold). We will probably meet reindeers and lemings, a lot of different birds, and if we are lucky even meet the artic fox.</p>
