                <h2>Nordic Skating - your own tour</h2>
                <p class="lead">Enjoy Nordic skating together with your friends or family. When booking your own private tour you can come any date and stay as long as you like. You can chose type of accommodation and combine skating with other activities if you like.</p>
                <p>We always travel with small groups and most of our guests are private groups. Maximum eight persons and one guide in a van. If you are less than eight is no problem, if you are more, we use a second van.</p>
                <p>The guide pick you up at the airport or where you like to be picked up. If possible we go directly for skating on a good lake nearby. All needed equipment are provided.</p>
                <p>Where we skate depends on the ice and weather situation, we always choose the area that provides the best skating conditions. The accommodations are located in the area but could change from day to day depending on where we choose to go skating.</p>
                
                <h4>A normal day on the ice</h4>
                <p>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we head of for skating. If we are lucky we stay close to the lake and walk directly out on the ice. Otherwise we take the van to the lake.  The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we make several stops when we go ashore, for the first or second lunch break or for walking to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the van and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>

                <h4>About the skates</h4>
                <img src="/images/500-300/skiing003.jpg">
                <p>We use special skates well adopted for Nordic skating. They are longer than hockey or figure skates. The front has a long curve compared with speed skates sharp front. Necessary if the ice in not complete smooth. And most important, the skate and the boot are separate so you can take of the skate when walking to and from the ice. If you have suitable skates, for example the Salomon skates, you may use them if you like.</p>
 
                <h4>About safety</h4>
                <img src="/images/500-300/skiing003.jpg">
                <p>Safety is an important issue. We cover great distance on the ice during a day. The whole time we keep track on the quality of the ice and avoid all week areas. But if we still have an accident and someone fell through the ice the safety equipment we have help us to pick up the person in a minute. And soon all wet cloth are changed to dry and warm cloth. The skating trip can continue.</p> 
                <p>PS: The only time we had a person fell into the water, they had not follow the given instructions.</p>

                <h4>Program for the four days</h4>
                <h4>Day I</h4>
                <P>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and if possible we start skating already in the afternoon. We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. Time to change to proper cloth if you have not. Late afternoon we drive towards the chosen skating area. Arriving to the hostel/hotel you check in and then we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</P>
                <h4>Day II â€“ III</h4>
                <P>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on distance we walk or take the minibus towards the ice. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we get the gear on and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we make several stops when we go ashore to take something to eat or walk to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>
                <h4>Day IV</h4>
                <P>After breakfast we head off for another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the scheduled departure times. On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and change clothes and maybe for something to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.</P>
