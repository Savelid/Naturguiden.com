                    <h1>Nordic Skating - your own tour</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Enjoy Nordic skating together with your friends or family. When booking your own private tour you can
                        come any date and stay as long as you like. You can chose the type of accommodation and combine skating
                        with other activities if you like.</p>
                    <p>We always travel in small groups and most of our guests are private groups. We are maximum eight persons
                        and one guide and travel in a minibus. If you are more than eight we use a second bus.
                    </p>
                    <p>The guide picks you up at the airport or where you like to be picked up. If possible we go directly for
                        skating on a good lake nearby. All required equipment is provided.</p>
                    <p>Where we skate depends on the ice and weather situation, we always choose the area that provides the
                        best skating conditions. The accommodations are located in the area but could change from day to
                        day depending on where we choose to go skating.</p>

                    <h3>A normal day on the ice</h3>
                    <p>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we head
                        off for skating. If we are luckycan walk from our accomodation directly out on the ice. Otherwise
                        we take the minibus to the lake. The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking out for
                        weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice condition. Now and then we
                        take short stops to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we go ashore
                        from time to time, for the first or second lunch break or for walking to another lake nearby. At
                        the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before
                        the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating
                        trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>

                    <h3>About the skates</h3>
                    <p>We use special skates well adopted for Nordic skating. They are longer than hockey or figure skates.
                        The front has a long curve compared to speed skates with sharp front, which is necessary if the ice
                        in not completely smooth. And most important, the skate and the boot are separate so you can take
                        off the skate when walking to and from the ice. If you have suitable skates, for example the Salomon
                        skates, you may use them if you like.
                    </p>

                    <h3>About safety</h3>
                    <img width="300" src="/images/500/safety_eq.jpg" class="right-image image-width-md">
                    <p>
                        Safety is an important issue. We cover great distances on the ice during a day. The whole time we keep track of the quality
                        of the ice and avoid all weak areas. If someone should break through the ice the safety equipment
                        we have helps us to pick the person up in a minute. And soon all wet clothes are changed to dry and
                        warm clothes. The skating trip can continue.
                    </p>
                    <p>PS: The only time we had a person falling into the water, they did not follow the given instructions.</p>

                    <p>
                        Safety equipment we carry: backpack, safety line, ice nails and poles

                    <h3>Program for the four days</h3>
                    <h3>Day I</h3>
                    <P>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and if possible we start skating already in the afternoon.
                        We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. Time to change to proper
                        clothes if you have not yet done that. Late afternoon we drive towards the chosen skating area. Arriving
                        to the hostel/hotel you check in and then we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</P>
                    <h3>Day II – III</h3>
                    <P>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on distance we walk or take
                        the minibus towards the ice. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we put on the skates
                        and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking
                        out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice condition. Now and
                        then we take short stops to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we go
                        ashore from time to time to take something to eat or walk to another lake nearby. At the end of the
                        day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is
                        a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight
                        late in the evening.</p>
                    <h3>Day IV</h3>
                    <P>After breakfast we head off to another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the scheduled
                        departure times. On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and to change clothes and maybe
                        for something to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.</P>
