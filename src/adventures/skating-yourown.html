                        <h1>Nordic Skating - your own tour</h1>
                        <p class="lead">Enjoy Nordic skating together with your friends or family. When booking your own private tour you
                            can come any date and stay as long as you like. You can chose type of accommodation and combine
                            skating with other activities if you like.</p>
                        <p>We always travel with small groups and most of our guests are private groups. Maximum eight persons
                            and one guide in a van. If you are less than eight is no problem, if you are more, we use a second
                            van.
                        </p>
                        <p>The guide pick you up at the airport or where you like to be picked up. If possible we go directly
                            for skating on a good lake nearby. All needed equipment are provided.</p>
                        <p>Where we skate depends on the ice and weather situation, we always choose the area that provides
                            the best skating conditions. The accommodations are located in the area but could change from
                            day to day depending on where we choose to go skating.</p>

                        <h3>A normal day on the ice</h3>
                        <p>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we
                            head of for skating. If we are lucky we stay close to the lake and walk directly out on the ice.
                            Otherwise we take the van to the lake. The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking
                            out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now
                            and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the
                            day we make several stops when we go ashore, for the first or second lunch break or for walking
                            to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the van and head back to the hotel/hostel.
                            A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might
                            go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>

                        <h3>Program for the four days</h3>
                        <h3>Day I</h3>
                        <P>Arrival at the airport. The guide will meet you and if possible we start skating already in the afternoon.
                            We start with a safety and security briefing and then hand out all equipment. Time to change
                            to proper cloth if you have not. Late afternoon we drive towards the chosen skating area. Arriving
                            to the hostel/hotel you check in and then we have dinner at the hostel/hotel.</P>
                        <h3>Day II – III</h3>
                        <P>We have breakfast and also time to prepare the lunch packages. Depending on distance we walk or take
                            the minibus towards the ice. At the lake we start by examining the ice before we get the gear
                            on and step out on the ice. We skate in a row, the guide always first, checking the ice and looking
                            out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice situation. Now
                            and then we make short stops, to admire the beauty, chat for a while or just rest. During the
                            day we make several stops when we go ashore to take something to eat or walk to another lake
                            nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice
                            sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for
                            another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</p>
                        <h3>Day IV</h3>
                        <P>After breakfast we head off for another day on ice, skating as long as possible depending on the
                            scheduled departure times. On our way back to the airport we stop for a shower and change clothes
                            and maybe for something to eat. The guide then drives you back to the airport.</P>
