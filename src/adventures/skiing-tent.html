                <h2>Tent tour</h2>
                <p class="lead">Cross country skiing over the mountains. Experience the space and the meditative in crossing the mountains
                    on skies. Enjoy the breaks with beautiful views sitting in our dug couches eating our lunch.
                </p>
                <p>We spend the nights in mountains lodges enjoy the time together during the evening.</p>
                <p>First day we start training downhill skiing with cross country skies. Good to have knowledge when we get
                    up on the mountains. You carry your own backpack with personal equipment during the tour.</p>

                <p>Cross country skies in the Swedish mountains. We crossing a almost white landscape, not that steep as in
                    the Alps and no trees as you can see on the picture. We use “ordinary” skies for cross country skiing,
                    skies with steel edge and back country bindings. Depending on what you prefer we went over the tops,
                    up and then downhill, maybe with nice telemark turns, or we went around the tops, not that much up and
                    down.

                <p class="bg-info">Suggestion for a 3 nights trip</p>
                <h4>Day 1</h4>
                <p>Arrival at Östersund airport or by train at the station. Transfer with bus to Ljungdalen. Your guide will
                    meet you at the bus stop and show you the way to the hostel. You get your room and then we will have
                    a nice dinner together. After dinner we try out ski boots and skies and wind down the evening by informing
                    you about the following days, the weather forecast and all you need to know.</p>
                <h4>Day II</h4>
                <p>After breakfast buffet but before we head off for the mountains, we prepare ourselves big lunch packages.
                    The first stage is up to the ski slope. Before we start we need some exercise in going downhill on cross
                    country skies. It is a little tricky, but with the right technique it becomes much easier.</p>
                <p>After exercising we eat our lunch in the ski slope and then let the ski lift pull us up towards the summit
                    once again. This time we should not go downhill again but continue towards the very top. When passing
                    it you get marvellous views, mountains everywhere. We will see the dramatic mountain Helags, the target
                    for tomorrow, in front of us, but we head of towards Fältjägaren, a small cabin in the middle of noware.
                    It starts with a small slope, your practise will come handy. Then we leave the trail and head straight
                    in between the mountains, the guide showing the right way. We take some breaks along the way and reach
                    Fältjägaren in the late afternoon. Fältjägaren is a small lodge with two big rooms. Built by the military
                    after an accident when a patrol got lost in bad weather and one person froze to death. . It has no washing
                    facilities and the toilet is in a separate building. After skiing the whole day it is now time to prepare
                    the dinner together and end up the day around the small table in the cabin. You will probably sleep well
                    after this long day.</p>
                <h4>Day III</h4>
                <p>You will wake up with the view of Helags, one of the highest mountains in Sweden, 1797 meters. If the weather
                    is good enough we probably will be at the top before this day has end. After breakfast and a couple of
                    hours skiing we reach the the mountain and start the climbing. We enjoy the day and are in no hurry.
                    When it starts to get more steep we stop for a lunch break. We dig a cosy couch in the snow that gives
                    us shelter. The couch is a perfect place for lunch, still with awesome views. From here we walk on the
                    snow to the summit, leaving skies and backpacks behind. One hour later we reach the top and we will have
                    amazing views in all directions. It feels satisfying to put our names in the guestbook after climbing
                    an altitude difference of 800 meters.</p>
                <p>Back to the skies and time for a short break in our cosy couch Then we continue towards Helags mountain lodge,
                    our next stop. Downhill almost the whole way. Before we leave to our lodge we will have time to relax.
                    After skiing the whole day it is now time to prepare the dinner together and end up the day in the warming
                    and relaxing sauna and a nice shower.</p>
                <h4>Day IV</h4>
                <p>This day we follow the marked tracks towards Ljungdalen. If we have met no people in earlier days, we will
                    probably meet some today. It goes up and down over some minor mountains and after 13 km, you get the
                    last part downhill from the mountain through the forest down to the village Ljungdalen. In the afternoon
                    we are back. A welcome shower or maybe a visit to the small indoor swimming pool is waiting. A good dinner
                    ends a fantastic tour before it is time for the bus back to Östersund.</p>
