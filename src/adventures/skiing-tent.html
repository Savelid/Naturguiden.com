                            country skiing, skies with steel edge and back country bindings. Depending on what you prefer
                            we went over the tops, up and then downhill, maybe with nice telemark turns, or we went around
                            the tops, not that much up and down.

                        <h3>Day 1</h3>
                        <p>Arrival at Östersund airport or by train at the station. Transfer with bus to Ljungdalen. Your guide
                            will meet you at the bus stop and show you the way to the hostel. You get your room and then
                            we will have a nice dinner together. After dinner we try out ski boots and skies and wind down
                            the evening by informing you about the following days, the weather forecast and all you need
                            to know.</p>
                        <h3>Day II</h3>
                        <p>After breakfast buffet but before we head off for the mountains, we prepare ourselves big lunch packages.
                            The first stage is up to the ski slope. Before we start we need some exercise in going downhill
                            on cross country skies. It is a little tricky, but with the right technique it becomes much easier.</p>
                        <p>After exercising we eat our lunch in the ski slope and then let the ski lift pull us up towards the
                            summit once again. This time we should not go downhill again but continue towards the very top.
                            When passing it you get marvellous views, mountains everywhere. We will see the dramatic mountain
                            Helags, the target for tomorrow, in front of us, but we head of towards Fältjägaren, a small
                            cabin in the middle of noware. It starts with a small slope, your practise will come handy. Then
                            we leave the trail and head straight in between the mountains, the guide showing the right way.
                            We take some breaks along the way and reach Fältjägaren in the late afternoon. Fältjägaren is
                            a small lodge with two big rooms. Built by the military after an accident when a patrol got lost
                            in bad weather and one person froze to death. . It has no washing facilities and the toilet is
                            in a separate building. After skiing the whole day it is now time to prepare the dinner together
                            and end up the day around the small table in the cabin. You will probably sleep well after this
                            long day.</p>
                        <h3>Day III</h3>
                        <p>You will wake up with the view of Helags, one of the highest mountains in Sweden, 1797 meters. If
                            the weather is good enough we probably will be at the top before this day has end. After breakfast
                            and a couple of hours skiing we reach the the mountain and start the climbing. We enjoy the day
                            and are in no hurry. When it starts to get more steep we stop for a lunch break. We dig a cosy
                            couch in the snow that gives us shelter. The couch is a perfect place for lunch, still with awesome
                            views. From here we walk on the snow to the summit, leaving skies and backpacks behind. One hour
                            later we reach the top and we will have amazing views in all directions. It feels satisfying
                            to put our names in the guestbook after climbing an altitude difference of 800 meters.</p>
                        <p>Back to the skies and time for a short break in our cosy couch Then we continue towards Helags mountain
                            lodge, our next stop. Downhill almost the whole way. Before we leave to our lodge we will have
                            time to relax. After skiing the whole day it is now time to prepare the dinner together and end
                            up the day in the warming and relaxing sauna and a nice shower.</p>
                        <h3>Day IV</h3>
                        <p>This day we follow the marked tracks towards Ljungdalen. If we have met no people in earlier days,
                            we will probably meet some today. It goes up and down over some minor mountains and after 13
                            km, you get the last part downhill from the mountain through the forest down to the village Ljungdalen.
                            In the afternoon we are back. A welcome shower or maybe a visit to the small indoor swimming
                            pool is waiting. A good dinner ends a fantastic tour before it is time for the bus back to Östersund.</p>
