                        <p class="lead">Enjoy the beatifull archipelago of Sweden. Between islands and skerries, out in the open sea and
                            in secluded caves. We sleep in tents on the islands along the way, prepare the food over open
                            fire and wash ourselves in rock pools of the Baltic Sea.</p>
                        <p>With kayak out on the Baltic sea. Out among thousands of islands, most of them unsettled. The Swedish
                            “allemansrätt” gives us the opportunity to stay on any one of them. There is no fixed tour, the
                            wind and waves affect our plans and you never know where to spend the night. During the day we
                            take several stops, for a meal or just to stretch our legs. In the evening, after a swim we make
                            a fire and start making dinner. Maybe we manage to catch some fish that we can fry in the pan.</p>
                        <P>
                            You decide how you like to spend the days. How fast and long we go with the kayak. How much time you like to spend on
                            the islands, swiming or just relaxing.
                        </P>

                        <P>Below you have all information you need, but if you still have some more questions, don't hesitate
                            to contact us on info@naturguiden.se or on +46 70 53 53 630.</P>

                        <h3>A normal day in the archipelago</h3>
                        <p>We start with breakfast prepared at the shoreline on the camping stove, maybe porridge, bread and
                            tea/coffee. Then we put down our tents and stove everything in our kayaks. We head off out between
                            the islands. The weather and wind decide were we go, out on the open or close to the islands.</p>
                        <p>At lunch time we find a nice spot where we can prepare our lunch, take a swim or just stroll along
                            the shore line</p>
                        <p>In the evening we take a swim, spend time around the fire, and make dinner over open fire. Maybe
                            someone tries to catch a fish that we can eat as well. Just enjoy</p>

                        <h3>Meeting point</h3>
