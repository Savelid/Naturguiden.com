                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <p>Arrival at Östersund airport or by train at the station. Transfer with bus to Ljungdalen. Your guide
                        will meet you at the bus stop and show you the way to the hostel. You get your room and then we will
                        have a nice dinner together. After dinner we try out ski boots and skies and wind down the evening
                        by informing you about the following days, the weather forecast and all you need to know.</p>
                    <h4>Day II</h4>
                    <p>After breakfast buffet but before we head off for the mountains, we prepare ourselves big lunch packages.
                        The first stage is up to the ski slope. Before we start we need some exercise in going downhill on
                        cross country skies. It is a little tricky, but with the right technique it becomes much easier.</p>
                    <p>After exercising we eat our lunch in the ski slope and then let the ski lift pull us up towards the summit
                        once again. This time we should not go downhill again but continue towards the very top. When passing
                        it you get marvellous views, mountains everywhere. We will see the dramatic mountain Helags, the
                        target for tomorrow, in front of us, but we head of towards Fältjägaren, a small cabin in the middle
                        of noware. It starts with a small slope, your practise will come handy. Then we leave the trail and
                        head straight in between the mountains, the guide showing the right way. We take some breaks along
                        the way and reach Fältjägaren in the late afternoon. Fältjägaren is a small lodge with two big rooms.
                        Built by the military after an accident when a patrol got lost in bad weather and one person froze
                        to death. . It has no washing facilities and the toilet is in a separate building. After skiing the
                        whole day it is now time to prepare the dinner together and end up the day around the small table
                        in the cabin. You will probably sleep well after this long day.</p>
                    <h4>Day III</h4>
                    <p>You will wake up with the view of Helags, one of the highest mountains in Sweden, 1797 meters. If the
                        weather is good enough we probably will be at the top before this day has end. After breakfast and
                        a couple of hours skiing we reach the the mountain and start the climbing. We enjoy the day and are
                        in no hurry. When it starts to get more steep we stop for a lunch break. We dig a cosy couch in the
                        snow that gives us shelter. The couch is a perfect place for lunch, still with awesome views. From
                        here we walk on the snow to the summit, leaving skies and backpacks behind. One hour later we reach
                        the top and we will have amazing views in all directions. It feels satisfying to put our names in
                        the guestbook after climbing an altitude difference of 800 meters.</p>
                    <p>Back to the skies and time for a short break in our cosy couch Then we continue towards Helags mountain
                        lodge, our next stop. Downhill almost the whole way. Before we leave to our lodge we will have time
                        to relax. After skiing the whole day it is now time to prepare the dinner together and end up the
                        day in the warming and relaxing sauna and a nice shower.</p>
                    <h4>Day IV</h4>
                    <p>This day we follow the marked tracks towards Ljungdalen. If we have met no people in earlier days, we
                        will probably meet some today. It goes up and down over some minor mountains and after 13 km, you
                        get the last part downhill from the mountain through the forest down to the village Ljungdalen. In
                        the afternoon we are back. A welcome shower or maybe a visit to the small indoor swimming pool is
                        waiting. A good dinner ends a fantastic tour before it is time for the bus back to Östersund.</p>

                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <p>Arrival at Östersund Airport or with train at the station. Transfer with bus to Ljungdalen (14:20 – 18:05).
                        Your guide will meet you at the bus stop and show you the way to the hostel. You get your room and
                        then we will have a nice dinner together. After dinner we try out ski boots and skies and wind down
                        the evening by informing you about the following days, the weather forecast and all you need to know.</p>
                    <h4>Day II</h4>
                    <p>After breakfast buffet but before we head off for the mountains, we prepare ourselves big lunch packages.
                        The first stage is up to the ski slope. Before we start we need some exercise in going downhill on
                        cross country skies. It is a little tricky, but with the right technique it becomes much easier.</p>
                    <p>We eat our lunch in the ski slope and then let the ski lift pull us up towards the summit once again.
                        This time we should not go downhill again but continue towards the very top. When passing it you
                        get marvellous views, mountains everywhere. We continue for some hours before we find ourselves a
                        good place to build our igloos. We take turns with the shovel to dig a cave big enough. When ready
                        we put our sleeping pads on the beds and make ourselves comfortable in our new home. Before we prepare
                        our dinner there is time to relax. We end up the day with a short tour, watching the sun set and
                        getting warm before going to bed in our winter sleeping bags.</p>
                    <h4>Day III</h4>
                    <p>The third day, we wake up in our igloo, make ourselves a warm breakfast and then head of towards the
                        Helags, one of the highest mountains in Sweden, 1797 meters. If the weather is good enough we head
                        for the summit, starting the climb after a couple of hours skiing. Further on we leave our skies
                        and backpacks and walk the last ascent to the summit. One hour later we reach the top and we will
                        have amazing views in all directions. It feels satisfying to put our names in the guestbook after
                        climbing an altitude difference of 800 meters.</p>
                    <p>Back to the skies and time for a lunch break. We dig a cosy couch in the snow that gives us shelter.
                        The couch is a perfect place for lunch, still with unending views. Then we continue towards the mountain
                        station, downwards almost the whole way. Before we go to our lodge there is time to relax. Together,
                        we prepare dinner and eat and just relax afterwards.</p>
                    <h4>Day IV</h4>
                    <p>Today we go off the marked tracks altogether, 22 km strait over the mountains. The compass will show
                        us the way. If we have met some people in earlier days, we will not meet any today. It goes up and
                        down over some minor mountains and ends up in a valley. We enjoy the day and are in no hurry, the
                        sun is up to after eight o clock. Taking some nice breaks, we maybe try some ice fishing on the lakes
                        we pass over.</p>
                    <p>The last stretch down to Ljungdalen is downhill, hopefully not too steep. In the evening we are back
                        at the hostel. A welcome shower or maybe a visit to the small indoor swimming pool is waiting. A
                        good dinner ends a fantastic tour.</p>
                    <h4>Day V</h4>
                    <p>Early breakfast and then to the bus that leaves at 06.00. Back in Östersund at half past nine. Take an
                        early plane back home or take some hours in the city of Östersund.</p>

                        the year, we almost will experience the midnight sun, a time of the year when the sun only sets for
                        an hour midnight. We will then be able to ski during the whole day and the whole night. For sleeping,
                        there are nice cabins to spend the nights, or days in, depending on when we want to ski. The strong
                        sun and white snow makes it essential to bring sunglasses, a hat and sun factor.</p>

                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <p>Arrival at Kiruna Airport or with train at the station. Transfer with bus to Abisko. Your guide will
                        meet you at the airport. In Abisko we step on the skies and start our tour immediately. After a while,
                        getting away from the civilisation, we stop for a late lunch. The days are long this time of the
                        year, they almost never ends; we are in no hurry and take it easy up the mountains. In the evening
                        we reach our mountain cabin where we should spend three nights completely by our self. We make our
                        self comfortable and then start preparing dinner together. Maybe we can eat it outdoor? The mountain
                        cabin is very simple, but nice and clean. The toilet is in a separate building. The washing facilities
                        is a bucket in the common kitchen or outdoor.</p>
                    <h4>Day II</h4>
                    <p>The topic for this second day is a summit tour in the midnight sun. The sun sets at 23:40 and even later
                        on the summit.</p>
                    <p>But first breakfast in the morning and then a tour before lunch. We rest for a while in the cabin during
                        the afternoon or stays out in the sun to increase the tan. Dinner at five o’clock and then we head
                        of for the summit. Reaching it about 23:30, digging a couch towards the sun and then just wait to
                        se the sun hide behind the mountains for an hour. In the midnight hour we heading downhill again
                        back towards our cabin, reaching it approximately at dawn at 01:40</p>
                    <h4>Day III</h4>
                    <p>The third day, we wake up a little late and decide during breakfast where to ski this day. Maybe we take
                        a long tour, or find a nice slope for Telemarking or just enjoy the nice weather and make a couch
                        in the snow, relaxing and reading some book.</p>
                    <h4>Day IV</h4>
                    <p>A period of the year when night and day almost looks the same. We get up real early in the morning, the
                        sun already high on the sky. Today we heading back towards the civilisation, slightly downhill all
                        the way back to Abisko. Then transfer back to Kiruna and the airport.</p>
