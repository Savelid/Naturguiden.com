                        <p>It's great adventure, it's fun, it's skating on natural ice. Imagine a lake, completely frozen with smooth and black ice, you are just gliding easily along the scenic shoreline. Suddenly you stop, the perfect place for the first lunch break. The smooth rock goes out into the lake and disappear under the ice, no wind and sunny.</p>
                        <p>Enjoy Nordic skating in Sweden, choose between our weekend tours or do as many of our guests do, book your own private tour with your friends or family.</p>

                        <p>Cross country skiing in the Swedish mountains during the best time of the year, the fifth season:
                            still winter, but with long lasting sunshine days. Sun factor 20 is needed.</p>

                        <p>We cross the snowy mountains under a blue sky, take our breaks in dug couches of snow (***) and spend the
                            nights in mountain lodges. Days of enjoyment, experience and fantastic views!</p>

                        <p>Join us on our Kayak tours in the beautiful archipelago of the Baltic sea. Between islands and skerries,
                            out in the open sea and in seduced caves (***). There are thousands of islands, most of them unsettled.
                            The Swedish "allemansrätt" gives us the right to camp on any one of them. At lunchtime we make
                            a break on some island, cook a meal, maybe take a swim. In the evenings we camp on another island,
                            make dinner over open fire and sleep in tents.</p>
