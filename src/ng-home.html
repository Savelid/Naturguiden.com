                        <p>John Savelid is waiting for me at Stockholm airport holding a strange bag that looks like a rucksack
                            with too many straps. "It's a day sack for skating," he tells me, "but also a life jacket in
                            case you go through."</p>

                        <p>It was the question on all of our minds, but I asked it: "How do you know when the ice isn't safe
                            to skate on?" Niklas, our imperturbable guide, rubbed his chin, looked thoughtful for a moment,
                            then offered up the distilled wisdom of a lifetime spent playing around on frozen water. "When
                            it breaks," he said with a broad smile.</p>

                        <p>We had skated just over six miles when we reached the edge. The ice just stopped, and the liquid
                            version of the Baltic Sea stretched out to the horizon. I hadn’t expected this sudden, ­unnerving
                            divide. I hadn’t expected to be so far from land. And I hadn’t ­expected to be told that the
                            solid surface I was standing on was only 3in thick.</p>

                        <p>I take my first steps out on to the frozen waters of the Baltic and my legs lock with fear. All that
                            practice on the Christmas rink feels like a futile flirtation as my Swedish guide gently urges
                            me to put my trust in the long metal “tour skating” blades and slide.</p>

                            involves ice-fishing and, if conditions allow, moon-skating.</p>

                        <p>I am in the middle of a Swedish lake watching winter melt away. The snow has gone and birch trees
                            which cover surrounding islands are starting to bud. I should be worried, given that I am standing
                            on ice, about three kilometres from land, and cracks are literally forming all around me, creating
                            a thudding noise which reverberates across the bay, and through my body.</p>
