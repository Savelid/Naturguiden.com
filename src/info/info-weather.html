                <h1>Weather in Sweden</h1>
                <p class="lead">What about the weather, what can we expect when coming to Sweden?</p>
                <p>As the main thing with the holiday is the outdoor activity, the weather is important.</p>
                <p>The weather depends of course on time of year and where in Sweden the tour take place. We will here try to
                    give you a ruff idea so you know what to expect.</p>
                <p>Below we present two tables with average temperature during night and during daytime for each month. You
                    also see the amount of rain or snow for each month (it is measured in millimetre water, when it comes
                    as snow you will get approximately ten times more in thickness.)</p>
                <h3>Summertime</h3>
                <p>The temperature is an average value and measured in the shadow. In the mountain you might have down to four
                    degrees and rain and windy even in the middle of the summer and it can be 25 degrees and clear blue sky
                    a couple of days later. Here we are completely exposed to the weather, there is no shelter. We always
                    recommend to bring both gloves, a cap and a swim suite when going to the mountains.</p>
                <p>When hiking in the south of Sweden there is not that extremes, the forest give us shelter. A sunny day in
                    July we can have around 25 – 30 degrees, and cold and rainy day it might be around 18 degrees.</p>
                <p>When come to kayak tours you are more dependent to the weather and specially to the wind. But as there are
                    thousands of small islands along the cost you can always get some shelter. The temperature relates to
                    the temperature of the water. The spring is more cold than the autumn. Therefore late summer is the best
                    choice for a kayak tour and even late autumn is fantastic in the archipelago. During summertime it is
                    important to have a long arm jumper, sunglasses and a hat otherwise you might get burn being out on the
                    water the whole day.</p>
                <h3>Wintertime</h3>
                <p>On our winter activities you can expect temperatures between zero and minus twenty degrees. It could be
                    snowfall and windy. On our skating tours we might even have around zero and rain. And on our ski tours
                    in the mountain during April or May there could such warm and sunny days that you can ski with only a
                    T-shirt. The best recommendation is to have several layers of clothes to be able to adapt to the actual
                    temperature.
