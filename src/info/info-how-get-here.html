                <h1>How to get here</h1>
                <p class="lead">We have adapt all our tours to make it easy for you to get here. Some of our tours starts right at the airport and the others at the railway station or bus stop. For each tour you can find information about where we pick you up.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

                <h3>For private tours</h3>
                <p>If you are a group of your own we can pick you up on other places as well. We can also do the tour somewhere else if you have other preferences , contact us.</p>
                <h2>Skating tours:</h2>
                <p>On all our skating tours we pick you up at the airport, or elsewhere after agreement. Most of our guests arrive at Stockholm airport – Arlanda.</p>
                <p>But as some prefer RyanAir we can also pick you up at Stockholm south -Skavsta after agreement. Do not book your ticket before an agreement, we need coordinate the pick up / drop of with the pick up / drop of at Arlanda.</p>
                <p><b>Or elsewhere:</b> If you arrive before the actual day we can pick you up elsewhere after agreement. If you stay close to Arlanda then we pick you up at your hotel before we pick up the others at the airport. If you stay in Stockholm center we can not pick you up at your hotel because of the traffic situation. But we can pick you up at Rotebro Train station where you travel easily with the local trains. (West side of the track, left side of your train). From here it is a short way to the airport.</p>
                <p>Last day we drop you of at the airport or at your hotel. Sunday evening is no rush hour and we can drop you of at your hotel in Stockholm if you like.</p>

                <h2>Kayak tours:</h2>
                <p>As we do our kayak tours in the Baltic sea archipelago we have chose to start our kayak tours in Trosa or in Nyköping, both located south of Stockholm. It is quiet easy to get here with public transportation. </p>
                <p><b>Trosa:</b> From Stockholm you take the train south to Vagnhärad and then change to bus 550. You end up in Trosa harbor where we meet you. Travel time around 1 hour.</p>
                <p><b>Nyköping:</b> If you travel with RyanAir to Sweden, then you arrive at Stockholm south – Skavsta. That is the airport of Nyköping. From the airport you take the local bus to the central bus station where we meet you.<br />
                If you travel from Stockholm you take the train to Nyköping. Travel time 1 hour. We meet you at the train station.</p>

                <h2>Hiking and Skiing:</h2>
                <p>We do our hiking and skiing tours in Jämtland, in the middle of Sweden close to the Nowegian border. The tours normally starts in Ljungdalen. Unfortunately it is not straight forward to get here. But it is possible with public transports and there are several different options. And you can of course use a rental car the last part if you prefer that.</p>
                <div class="high-light">But when you get here, the travel was worth while, It is a great place if you like the mountains, and we do.</div>
                <p>Ljungdalen is not that far from Funäsdalen and if it's more easy for you to get there we will arrange with the transport the last bit to Ljungdalen. You will then travel over Flatruet, the highest road in Sweden and a famous tourist attraction.</p>
                <p>We will of course help you with the information you need.</p>
