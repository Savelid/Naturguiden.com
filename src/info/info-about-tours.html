                <h3>Accommodation</h3>
                <p>We choose the best possible accommodation for each package depending on location and availability. In our
                    packages the accommodation is already chosen in advance. However for some of the packages it is possible
                    to choose between several types of accommodations, although all participants need to make the same choice.</p>
                <h5>We offer these types of accommodation:</h5>
                <ul class="nothing-list">
                    <li><b>Hotel</b>, twin or double rooms with toilet and shower in each room.</li>

                <h5>More information in accommodation</h5>
                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>We offer full board meals to all our packages, in some of the packages meals are served in restaurants, in
                    others they are prepared by the guide and in other packages preparing the food is a part of the experience.
                    We often eat some of the meals outside during the tours – food always tastes very good out in nature!</p>
                <p>Information about, for example, vegetarians/vegans in the party, or about persons with allergies, needs to
                    be provided well in advance.</p>
                <h3>Groups</h3>
                <p>All our guided adventures are for smaller groups, normally between 6-10 persons. There are fixed dates for
                    all packages. We claim the right to cancel a trip if there are less than 3 persons.</p>
                <p>We can also help individuals with booking of extra nights, tickets or activities if they would like to arrive
                    earlier or leave later.</p>
                <p>For an entire group (at least 6 persons) you choose any date that suites you. Naturguiden has a high flexibility
                    and can adjust any of the packages to meet the wishes of an entire group.</p>
                <p>If there is a group of less than 6 persons who would like to experience one of our packages without other
                    participants that is possible with an agreed fee.</p>
                <h3>Gradient</h3>
                <p>The gradient on the packages is based on the needed condition rather than the technical skills.</p>
                <ul class="nothing-list">
                    <li><strong>Easy</strong>: for everyone with “normal” physique.</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle</strong>: active people, but not necessary exercise regularly</li>
                    <li><strong>Tough</strong>: nothing extreme, but recommended for people that exercise regularly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The difficulty level of the activities and the tempo will of course be suited to match the group.</p>
                <h3>Environment</h3>
                <p>All of Naturguiden activities take place in our wonderful outdoors. To be able to continue doing this it
                    is important to reduce the impact on our countryside as much as possible. Naturguiden is a member of
                    the Swedish Ecotourism Society and we have products that are certified according to Natures Best,
                    <a href="http://www.naturesbestsweden.com/">www.naturesbestsweden.com</a></p>
                <p>None of our packages contains activities that have a negative impact on the environment (like rib boats,
                    snowmobiles, etc). We try to minimize the transports and use public transport as much as possible. Our
                    goal is to leave no trace.</p>
                <h3>Price:</h3>
                <p>All prices are given in Euro. We claim the right to change the price due to changes in exchange rates.</p>
                <p>Full payment must take place at the latest two weeks prior the arrival date.</p>
