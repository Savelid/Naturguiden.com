                <h1>About Sweden</h1>
                <p class="lead">Sweden has a lot to offer when it comes to outdoor sports. With over 250.000 lakes, 1.350 km of coast with
                    more than 40.000 islands and several big rivers, we have one of the best areas in
                    the world for skating on natural ice, awesome. Kayaking in the archipelago or on any of the lakes is also
                    fantastic.
                </p>
                <p>The forest is another reason for being a great outdoor nation, over 50% is forest. Fantastic opportunities
                    for biking, hiking, hunting, cross country skiing or going by snowmobiles or dog sledges.</p>
                <p>Then we have the mountains, high areas without trees. Down hill skiing is almost a national sport, cross
                    country skiing something all kids learn. Ski tours in the mountain are popular in wintertime as well as
                    hiking tours in summertime of course. Visit the mountains in April, the fifth season. Still cold and snowy but
                    long lasting sunny days.</p>
                <p>Sweden is a long country, 1.570 km, and the climate changes a lot from North to South. In winter the average
                    temperature is around 0 degrees in the South and about minus 20 - 30 degrees in the North. In summer the temperature
                    is around 20 - 25 degrees in the South and around 10 degrees in the North. Midnight sun in summer and no sun
                    at all during a couple of weeks around Christmas in the North. To tell what´s normal in Sweden is not possible,
                    it´s all about where you are.</p>
                <p>It is all about space, we have 22 persons/km² in Sweden, 10 million on 450.000 km². Compare to the Netherlands
                    that have 410 persons/km². Together with the ”allemansrätt” that gives us the right to travel and camp
                    anywhere (except in someone´s garden). Sweden is perfect if you are looking for freedom and peacefulness.</p>
                <p>Our currency is still Kronor (SEK), we have not changed to Euro. The exchange rate is around [[exchangeRate]]
                    SEK for 1 EUR. (If you divide the Swedish price with 10 you got the price in Euro approximately)</p>
                <p>On all our tours everything you need is included (there is some exception). On some tours you not even have
                    much opportunity to spend money. But if you want some money to be able to buy a beer or something else,
                    you can always withdraw money on the airport. You can also use credit cards almost everywhere.</p>
                <p>You get along well with English in Sweden, most people will understand you. With other languages it can be more difficult
                     even though there are people knowing German, French, Spanish etc.</p>
                <p>More information about Sweden is found on the web page of Visit Sweden <a href="https://visitsweden.com/">visitsweden.com</a></p>
                <p>More information about what to bring and what to wear you find connected to each type of tour.</p>
