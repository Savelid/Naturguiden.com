                <h1>About Sweden</h1>
                <p class="lead">Sweden have a lot to offer when coming to outdoor sports. With over 250.000 lakes, 1.350 km of coast with
                    more than 40.000 islands, several big rivers, water is one big reason. We have one of the best area in
                    the world for skating on natural ice, awesome. Kayak in the archipelago or on any of the lakes is also
                    fantastic.
                </p>
                <p>The forest is another reason for being a great outdoor nation, over 50% is forest. Fantastic opportunities
                    for biking, hiking, hunting, cross country skies, snowmobiles, dog sledge and such things..</p>
                <p>Then we have the mountains, high areas without trees. Down hill skies is almost a national sport . Cross
                    country skies something all kids learn. Hiking on skies in the mountain is popular in wintertime and
                    hiking in summertime of course. Visit the mountains in April the fifth season. Still cold and snow but
                    long lasting sunny days.</p>
                <p>Sweden is a long country 1.570 km and the climate change a lot from north to south. In winter the average
                    temperature is around 0 degree in south and about minus 20 - 30 degrees in north. In summer the temperature
                    is around 20 - 25 degrees in south and around 10 degrees in north. Midnight sun in summer and no sun
                    at all during a couple of week around Christmas in north. To tell what´s normal in Sweden is not possible,
                    it´s all about were you are.</p>
                <p>It is all about space, we have 22 persons/km² in Sweden. 10 million on 450.000 km². Compare with Netherlands
                    that have 410 persons/km². Together with the ”allemansrätt” that gives us the right to travel and camp
                    anywhere (except in someone´s garden) Sweden is a perfect if you looking for freedom and peacefulness.</p>
                <p>Our currency is still Kronor (SEK), we have not change to Euro. The exchange rate is around [[exchangeRate]]
                    SEK for 1 EUR. (If you divide the Swedish price with 10 you got the price in Euro approximately)</p>
                <p>On all our tours everything you need is included (there is some exception). On some tours you not even have
                    much opportunity to spend money. But if you want some money to be able to by a beer or something else,
                    you can always withdraw money on the airport. You can also use credit card almost everywhere.</p>
                <p>You manage good with English in Sweden, most people will understand you. With other language there is more
                    difficulty even though there are people knowing German, French, Spanish etcetera</p>
                <p>More information about Sweden is found on the web page of Visit Sweden <a href="http://www.visitsweden.se/sweden">www.visitsweden.com/sweden</a></p>
                <p>More information about what to bring and what to wear you find connected to each product category.</p>
