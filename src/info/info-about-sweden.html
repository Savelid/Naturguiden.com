                    <h1>About Sweden</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Sweden have a lot to offer when coming to outdoor sports. With over 250.000 lakes, 1.350 km of coast
                        with more than 40.000 islands, several big rivers, water is one big reason. We have one of the best
                        area in the world for skating on natural ice, awesome. Kayak in the archipelago or on any of the
                        lakes is also fantastic.</p>
                    <p>The forest is another reason for being a great outdoor nation, over 50% is forest. Fantastic opportunities
                        for biking, hiking, hunting, cross country skies, snowmobiles, dog sledge and such things..</p>
                    <p>Then we have the mountains, high areas without trees. Down hill skies is almost a national sport . Cross
                        country skies something all kids learn. Hiking on skies in the mountain is popular in wintertime
                        and hiking in summertime of course. Visit the mountains in April the fifth season. Still cold and
                        snow but long lasting sunny days.</p>
                    <p>Sweden is a long country 1.570 km and the climate change a lot from north to south. In winter the average
                        temperature is around 0 degree in south and about minus 20 - 30 degrees in north. In summer the temperature
                        is around 20 - 25 degrees in south and around 10 degrees in north. Midnight sun in summer and no
                        sun at all during a couple of week around Christmas in north. To tell what´s normal in Sweden is
                        not possible, it´s all about were you are.</p>
                    <p>It is all about space, we have 20 persons/km2 in Sweden. 8,8 million on 450.000 km2. Compare with Netherlands
                        that have 375 persons/km2. Together with the ”allemansrätt” that gives us the right to travel and
                        camp anywhere (except in someone garden) Sweden is a perfect if you looking for freedom and peacefulness.</p>
                    <p>Our currency is still Kronor (SEK), we have not change to Euro. The exchange rate is around 9.2 SEK for
                        1 EUR. (If you divide the Swedish price with 10 you got the price in Euro approximately)</p>
                    <p>On all our tours everything you need is included (there is one exception). On some tours you not event
                        get the opportunity to spend any money.</p>
                    <p>But if you want some money to be able to by a beer or something else, you can always redraw money on
                        the airport. You can also use credit card almost everywhere.</p>
                    <p>You manage good with English in Sweden, most people will understand you. With other language there is
                        more difficult even though there are people knowing German, French, Spanish....</p>
